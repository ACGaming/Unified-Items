Unified Items is a mod to centralize ore generation and items into one simple to use package.
It is entirely modular by design and therefore only loads the necessary modules on runtime.
Each module is defined by a mod. Therefore only the materials necessary to play the game with the mods you have loaded are added.
You can manually force enable any supported material at any given time, using the in-game config gui.
